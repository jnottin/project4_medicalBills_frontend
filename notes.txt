****START TOMORROW:
    XXXXX-PASSING HOSPITAL INFO AS PROPS
    -Convert input to map COORDINATES
    -GETTING COORDINATES TO CONVERT TO MARKERS
    -WORK ON NEW MEDICAL BILL PAGE , GOOGLE MAPS PLACES TO WORK






Idea:
    -app for user uploaded medical bills
    -map api using:
        1) Location of hospital
        2) Price of procedure (but needs to be average of all prices in category)
        3) 

Problems with Idea:

    - CONVERT USER ADDRESS TO COORDINATES - google places / geocoding
        SOLVED - 
            1) User fills in new hospital through GOOGLE PLACES
        OR
            2) GEOCODING - convert normal address to long/lat, but does not confirm that it is a hospital
            
    - DISPLAY HOSP / INFO ON A MAP -
        SOLVED - using markers and google maps

    - PASS DB DATA TO MYMAP FUNCTION -
        SOLVED (I BELIEVE) - import MyMap function to views then feed in the data as a parameter
            OR
            - send the housed through views.py and then in the html template, filter correct houses...

    - CHANGE MARKER PRICES PER PROCEDURE
        - BASED ON - this needs to be a for loop that filters through the hospitals based on the ones that have prices for that procedure, then average those prices
    - QUERY THROUGH HOSP ON GOOGLE PLACES - using google places API  
    - # OF PROCEDURES - Choose 10 for now. Api for access to all procedure names?
    - REAL INSURANCE PROVIDER - list of national insurance, option for submitting their own
    -

Models:
    Procedure (one hospital):
        -name_of_procedure
        -cost
        -insurance_provider
        -date_of_procedure -- DATE FIGURE, like Charfield

    Hospital (many procedures):
        -name
        -location_normal
        -longitude
        -latitude
        -procedures


App Pages:
    1) Sign in Page
    2) Homepage, shows nothing until user enters:
        -procedure and zip code/city
        -OR selects SUBMIT MEDICAL BILL
    Then the map will show hospitals in that area that are on file. 

    3) Submit Medical Bill page - enter medical bill information
    4)



MVP:
    BRONZE:
        -
    


    SILVER:
        - DELETE MEDICAL BILL- user page, where they see the bills they uploaded and can delete them
    



    GOLD:
        -


FUNCTIONS:
    -HOMEPAGE:
        -ENTER ZIP AND PROCEDURE:
            1) Page loads, map blank (maybe zoomed out above whole US), force PROCEDURE and ZIP/CITY alert message if they try something
            2) Once PROCEDURE and ZIP/CITY given, 
                -search through my database of hospitals, EITHER only show those on the google map OR zoom in on arlignton but show all hospitals
                -show correct marker prices per procedure
